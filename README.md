# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
->Helps ensure that the project is on schedule.
They can ensure that all projects are delivered on time by:
->Being intouch with all the collaborators.
->Ensure that the project is doable with the allocated amount of time.
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
->By just getting only what is needed ie resources, materials and equipments.
Strategies used to prevent budgets overruns:
->Coming up with a budget plan.
->Only purchasing needed resources, materials and euipments.
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile methodology is Iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development while Waterfall methodology is a Linear and sequential approach each phase must be completed before the next begins.
Advantages:
Agile Methodology
- Quick response to changes.
- Regular customer feedback.
- Improved team collaboration.
Waterfall Methodology
- Clear structure and documentation.
- Easy to manage due to its rigidity.
Disadvantages:
Agile Methodology
- Less predictability.
- Requires significant customer involvement.
Waterfall Methodology
- Difficult to accommodate changes.
- Testing occurs late in the process.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile Methodology:
-Beneficial for projects with changing requirements and its a flexible methodology which works well with those projects which require regular updates.
Example: E-commerce systems
Waterfall Methodology 
-Beneficial for those project with well defined requirements that once created and lounched wont have any requirements changes.
example: Banking systems
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Code Reviews. 
Walk Throughs.
Manual and automated testing.
User Acceptance testing.
Importances:
Reduces bugs.
Enhances security.
Improves users satisfaction.
Reduces costs.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Project scope:
Prevents Scope Creep – Clearly defines deliverables, avoiding unnecessary changes.
Sets Clear Objectives – Ensures all stakeholders understand project goals.
Improves Resource Allocation – Helps assign time, budget, and manpower effectively.
Enhances Risk Management – Identifies potential risks and mitigation strategies.

Work Breakdown structure-> is a hierarchical decomposition of a project into smaller, manageable tasks.

Importances of a work Breakdown structure:
 Improves Project Organization – Provides a structured roadmap for execution.
 Enhances Task Management – Breaks complex tasks into smaller, manageable units.
 Improves Resource Allocation – Helps assign responsibilities effectively.
 Enhances Tracking & Monitoring – Facilitates progress measurement and deadline adherence.
 Aids in Cost Estimation – Helps in budgeting and financial planning.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Benefits of a detailed project schedule:
  Establishes a Project Timeline
  Monitors Team Performance
  Simplifies Project Management
  Promotes Best Practices
How a Gantt charts can assist in this process:
  Task and Milestone Tracking
  Gantt charts illustrate relationships between tasks, highlighting dependencies that could impact the project timeline
  By assigning tasks to specific team members, Gantt charts help in effectively distributing workloads and managing resources.
  Progress Monitoring

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
Security vulnerablities.
